                <p style="line-height: 40px;"><i style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 900;">  Fire Response Procedures:</i>
                    
                    In the event of a fire, individuals should immediately activate the nearest fire alarm and call the emergency services. They should then follow these steps:
                    
                    Remain calm and proceed to the nearest exit, closing doors behind you to contain the fire.
                    Use the stairs, not elevators, to evacuate the building.
                    If smoke is present, crawl low under the smoke to breathe cleaner air.
                    If a fire extinguisher is available and you are trained to use it, attempt to extinguish the fire, but do not put yourself at risk.
                    Once outside, proceed to the designated assembly point and await further instructions from emergency personnel.

                    Cover your body as much as possible, keeping your head protected.
                    Hold on to the desk or table, and be prepared to move with it if the shaking intensifies.
                    Remain in this position until the shaking stops and you are instructed to evacuate.</p>
